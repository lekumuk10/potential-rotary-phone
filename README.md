## Common Queries

### How can I incorporate a hitmarker sound?

Create a directory named "hitsounds" in the main Counter-Strike Global Offensive folder. Place as many .wav sound files as you want in this directory. Once the cheat is active, the hitmarker sounds will be available through the hitsounds dropdown.

### Where are the configuration files stored?

Profiles are stored in the main Counter-Strike Global Offensive directory under a folder named "profiles."

To share profiles, go to the cheat's configuration tab and select Export. This copies all profile data to the clipboard for sharing.

To import a profile, simply paste all the profile data and click Import. Don't forget to save your profile by giving it a name and clicking Save.
